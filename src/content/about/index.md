      Never satisfied with the status quo, we’re always searching for new
      technology and methods for creating a clean air competitive advantage:


      * Hexavalent Chromium Protection: Through independent testing, Duroair has verified that our exhaust systems meet or exceed NESHAP 319 standards by capturing and containing hexavalent chromium - allowing clean air to be recirculated back into the manufacturing space or vented outside.

      * Dust Collection Innovation: Because your employees are your most valuable assets, Duroair has developed [DuroDust™](#url), a dust collection system that provides a properly-vented, regulated work area that limits employees' exposure to respirable silica, metal dust, and other particulates.

      * Space-Saving Hinge Design: Space efficiency is always a priority, so Duroair has created a new hinge design that does not impact the enclosure footprint and moves up in the vertical wall axis, while the building retracts to under 20 percent of its extended length.
